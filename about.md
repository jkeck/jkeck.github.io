I'm a software developer with the Stanford University Libraries. I work on various web based products at the library,
but probably most notably [SearchWorks](http://searchworks.stanford.edu).  I'm also a core contributor the [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org) and
[Hydra](http://projecthydra.org).

This blog will be primarily random thoughts on the projects I'm working on, the technologies that I'm using, and methodologies to solving some of the problems I come across.

I don't currently plan on enabling commenting on the site but if you have any questions about any of the posts on the site
please feel free to contact me via email.
